First of all, classification may be based either on *binary* or *multinomial* response variables. Although similar, these two settings of classification require attention when calculating metrics for evaluation. In addition to statistics suited for multinomial problems (for example, multinomial deviance), some metrics used for binary problems, such as precision, recall, and F1 score, should be calculated for each class separetely (see references for sources with detailed discussion on metrics for multiclass classification).\n","<br>\n","<br>\n","This notebook focus on performance metrics for binary classification, even though some ideas or results may also hold for multinomial problems. A *statistical learning method* is applied to estimate a model $f(.)$ referenced by *parameters* $\\theta$. These parameters determine how inputs $X$ define the output $Y$. When the response variable is binary, $Y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, such as for the dataset used here, the estimation of $\\theta$ leads to the calculation of a *score* $P(y = 1|x, \\hat{\\theta})$ for a given data point $x$.\n","<br>\n","<br>\n","Metrics of performance for binary classification problems may either compare true labels with scores or true labels with predicted classes, where these follow from opposing scores with a predefined threshold to allocate data points to $Y = 1$ or to $Y = 0$. Not just that, some metrics may be explicitly dependent on the choice of a given threshold, or may consider several diffent thresholds, or even may not use any threshold at all. The approach here has separated metrics into those whose value consists on a rate and those that report some kind of score. The former class of metrics is prone to use a given threshold in its calculation.\n","<br>\n","<br>\n","Two relevant subjects concerning classification point to *class imbalance* and *domain knowledge*. A given dataset is imbalanced when the prior probability of some class, $P(Y = 1)$ for binary problems, is too low or too high. This should raise special care when applying and interpreting any performance metric. Domaing knowledge is also crucial, since different costs may follow from different sorts of misclassification, even when there are only two possible classes."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HEY1o4zlKLO_"},"source":["---------------------"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9qaB_0r-KK7t"},"source":["This notebook presents the definition and practical implementations of main metrics for classification tasks.

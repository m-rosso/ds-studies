This folder brings results and codes from tests conducted with the goal of assessing the specification of Gradient Boosting Model (GBM) hyper-parameters. The study opposes theoretical considerations to empirical evidence constructed upon the classification of several distinct datasets with binary response variables. As a result, appropriate ranges of values for the most important GBM hyper-parameters could be defined, namely: subsample **eta** [lilisca](https://google.com)

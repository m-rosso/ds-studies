This method is also known as **decision trees**, since its functioning for making predictions reproduces the way how humans make decisions in real life: by applying a set of rules that optimize the set of inputs given some goal in mind.\n","\n","The objective of this project is to review the theoretical understanding of *how decision trees are built* and *how they produce a prediction from an input vector*, and, most importantly, to strengthen this understanding by analyzing some *Python codes that implement the decision tree predictive modeling*.\n","\n","Decision trees are important for two main reasons: first, they are one of the greatest learning methods in terms of **interpretability and explainability**. Decision trees can be easily plotted, so their structure and construction are highly explainable both in words and with visualizations. Their functioning is also understandable given the graphical representation: an input vector $x$ can be moved through the nodes, so final predictions are immediately interpreted by the user.\n","\n","The second reason why the understanding of decision trees is so crucial in the machine learning domain relies on the fact that some of the most widely used and most effective learning algorithms are **tree-based**. Since decision trees are relatively simple in its structure, the trade-off between interpretability and performance implies that they are not expected to achieve appropriate levels of predictive performance in most empirical applications. However, methods constructed upon decision trees, such as *bagging, random forest, and gradient boosting*, try to reduce the variance or the bias of estimates by imposing more structure into the models, even that this would negatively affect their interpretability.\n","\n","The structure of a decision tree derives from binary splits that sequentially leads a data point from the root node, which applies to all observations in a given application, to a leaf (or terminal) node that applies only to a subset of observations for whom all intermediary nodes apply together. A decision tree is then composed from the following elements:\n","1. **Node:** gathers a subset of observations. So, it can be described by a dataset with features and a label (for a classification task), its length (i.e., the number of observations in the node) and the distribution of these observations across classes of the response variable (from which a measure of the quality of this split can be calculated). Such distribution (an average value for a regression task) is crucial for terminal nodes, since it gives rise to predictions for a given input vector $x$.\n","2. **Splits:** all nodes aside leaves can support one binary split, which depends on an input variable $X_j$, a relational operator ($<$, $\\leq$, $>$, $\\geq$ or $=$), and a value of reference $x_j$. Splits are then implemented through rules such as $X_j \\leq x_j$ (for a continuous variable), justifying the name *decision trees*. Consequently, apart from leaf nodes, all nodes are also described by an input variable (e.g., $X_j$) or by a rule (e.g., $X_j \\leq x_j$). As a split is applied over a node, its observations are further divided into two regions, one for which the rule applies and the other for the complement. In a graphical sense, the tree receives two branches leading to two additional (child) nodes, which can be described in the same way as their parent node. The splits can be depicted by looking into disjoint regions that are sequentially created in the features space. Given a complete tree, an input vector can only belong to a single terminal node and to a single subset of the features space.\n","3. **Levels:** a tree has distinct, non-decreasing levels, where each indicate how many splits have occurred so far. Imposing restrictions over the maximum level of a tree can control its complexity, since the higher the maximum depth, the more splits are done, and the more specific (pure) are the leaf nodes.\n","4. **Cost function:** for a split to be made, a feature and a feature value must be chosen. So, some criterium should guide the splitting process, i.e., the learning by the algorithm from the training data. For regression tasks, the mean squared error (MSE) is the most common choice as the cost function to be minimized at each split. For classification tasks, there are some alternatives, such as the Gini index, the cross-entropy, and the misclassification error rate. While the later may be appropriate for tuning the tree, the first two are the most common choices when it comes to growing a tree. Both of these functions consider the same principle: the more pure a node is (i.e., the less diverse it is in terms of distinct classes), the better. The Gini index can be expressed by:\n","\\begin{equation}\n","  \\displaystyle G(node) = \\sum_{k=1}^C p_k(1 - p_k)\n","\\end{equation}\n","\n","Where $p_k$ is the proportion of observations that belong to class $k$ in the node. The lower $G(node)$, the more pure the node is, since it will be more concentrated in one class. The cross-entropy, in its turn, is given by:\n","\\begin{equation}\n","  \\displaystyle Entropy(node) = -\\sum_{k=1}^C p_k\\log(p_k)\n","\\end{equation}\n","The lower the entropy (the chaos), the more concentrated the node will be in one class.\n","\n","Given the structure and components of a decision tree, the **tree construction** consists of a splitting process from which nodes are sequentially splitted until a termination criterium is met. The process of growing a tree locally optimizes the choice of features and values for the split, which means that the implementation of a split does not consider what would be the best choice regarding subsequent splits. In practice, a *greedy algorithm*, known as **binary recursive splitting**, tries to minimize the cost function at each possible split. This optimization iterates over all available  input variables and, then, for each splitting variable candidate, over all values that it assumes in the training data (or, alternatively, over the series of averages between consecutive - and sorted - values). Once the best pair of input variable and split value is found, the dataset is further divided into two disjoint subsets.\n","\n","The binary recursive splitting stops when at least one of two conditions applies for all current leaf nodes:\n","1. When the depth is no lower than a predefined value $J$, the **maximum tree depth**.\n","2. When the number of observations that fall into the node is lower than a predefined value $n_{min}$, the **minimum node size** (or, minimum samples split).\n","\n","Both of such **hyper-parameters** control the complexity of the tree: the higher tha maximum tree depth, the more splits can be implemented, since more levels can be created; the lower the minimum node size, the more splits can be implemented, since the data can be more and more fragmented into small-sized nodes. The more complex a tree is, however, the more likely it will suffer from overfitting, because the model becomes too dependent on the data it sees during the fitting. Of course, a tree that is too short may lead to the opposite problem: underfitting as a consequence of weak patterns found in the data (presented by nodes with a low degree of purity).\n","\n","The functioning of decision trees is also explained by how the **prediction** occurs for a given input vector. Since binary splits are sequentially made creating different disjoint regions in the features space, the prediction follows the average value of the response variable in the region where the input vector is located. For classification tasks, the average value refers to the proportion of observations in each class, thus consisting of a probability estimate and pointing to the most frequent class (for a label prediction). Considering the tree structure, an input vector moves across the tree until it finds a terminal node: there, the average value of a numerical response variable is calculated, or then the proportion of observations in each class is computed for classification tasks. At this point, it is relevant to highlight one aspect regarding the transition from decision trees to ensemble methods (as bagging, random forest and gradient boosting): the probability estimate is not given by the average vote across all trees in the ensemble, but by the probability estimate averaged over all trees.\n","\n","Below we find two implementations of decision trees that only make use of standard Python libraries. The first comes from [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/decision-tree-algorithm-in-python-from-scratch-8c43f0e40173) web article, while the second comes from [another](https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-decision-tree-algorithm-scratch-python/) article. The first implementation creates a Python class named \"Node\", which has several methods: one that calculates the Gini impurity index, another for finding the best split and the main method to grow the tree. The second implementation works with functions, and the main one builds a tree (using a function specific for that) and returns predictions on a test set. Other functions do the calculation of the Gini index, the implementation of splits and the search for the best split.\n","\n","It is central in both implementations the process of splitting: in the first, it occurs with the \"grow_tree\" method, as sequentially new nodes (a left and a right) are created and new trees (i.e., new splits) follow from each one of them. In the second, splits are made with the \"split\" function, which again creates nodes from previous ones. It is worth to notice how these implementations are highly chained in their structure. So, in the first approach, the \"grow_tree\" method is called inside itself from nodes created using the \"Node\" class in which the method is defined. In the second approach, the function \"split\" is also called inside itself. This chained nature reflects the fact that new nodes are created from splits applied over parent nodes.\n","\n","Besides the object-oriented or function-based approach, the implementations differ one from the other in the usage of the cost function: the first maximizes the Gini gain, i.e., the reduction in Gini impurity from the parent node, while the second minimizes the Gini impurity of the split. Another difference refers to the grid of values for splitting numerical variables: the first takes the average of consecutive and sorted values, while the second tries all values available in the training data.\n","\n","Finally, it should be mentioned possible extensions to the implementations presented here. Categorical inputs can be easily used for splittings, requiring no transformations. Different cost functions can be used instead of Gini impurity. Moreover, if one uses entropy instead of Gini index, again the objective function can be such that a minimization (of the entropy) or a maximization (of the information gain) should occur. The construction of terminal nodes can reflect a regression task, instead of a classification, and for a classification task the probability can be calculated together with the predicted label. Cost-complexity pruning can tune model performance by selecting the best subtree from a large grown tree."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tWi-Yyretplg"},"source":["**References**\n","<br>\n","[Decision tree algorithm in python from scratch](https://towardsdatascience.com/decision-tree-algorithm-in-python-from-scratch-8c43f0e40173).\n","<br>\n","[Implement decision tree algorithm scratch python](https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-decision-tree-algorithm-scratch-python/).\n","<br>\n","[Classification and regression trees for machine learning/](https://machinelearningmastery.com/classification-and-regression-trees-for-machine-learning/).\n","<br>\n","[Decision tree classifier explained in real-life: picking a vacation destination](https://towardsdatascience.com/decision-tree-classifier-explained-in-real-life-picking-a-vacation-destination-6226b2b60575).\n","<br>\n","[The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"YjtnwOcFtdtn"},"source":["----------------"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MIjG7vzVusXE"},"source":["The notebook initially imports all standard libraries needed.

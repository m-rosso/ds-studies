# Data science studies
This repository contains main conclusions and files used when performing some data science tests whose aim was to support projects in which I have participated througout the years. These projects, in their turn, are private, and thus can not be published here for confidentiality reasons.

Each folder in this repository applies for a specific study. All of them, however, are similar in their nature: they helped me understand some issues concerning predictive performance metrics, hyper-parameters specification, and so on. Maybe the most relevant folders are those that guide the implementation of LightGBM and XGBoost libraries for developing boosted models, besides of tutorials for implementing different methods of interpretable machine learning. A notebook with different implementations of decision trees from scratch helped me understand the structure, construction and functioning of this fundamental method.

1. Peformance metrics for classification tasks.
2. GBM hyper-parameters.
3. Performance metrics applied to grid search of binary classifications tasks.
4. LightGBM tutorial.
5. XGBoost tutorial.
6. Interpretable Machine Learning.
7. Decision trees.

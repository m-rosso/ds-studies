# ds-studies
This repository contains main conclusions and files used when performing some data science tests whose aim was to support projects in which I have participated througout the years. These projects, in their turn, are private, and thus can not be published here for confidentiality reasons.

Each folder in this repository applies for a specific study. All of them, however, are similar in their nature: they helped me (and I hope may also help you) understand some issues concerning predictive performance metrics, hyper-parameters specification, and so on.

1. Peformance metrics for classification tasks.
2. GBM hyper-parameters.
3. Performance metrics applied to grid search of binary classifications tasks.
